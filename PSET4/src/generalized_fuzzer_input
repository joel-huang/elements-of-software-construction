Implement
a
generalized
fuzzer
that
will
take
a
file
read
each
line
of
the
file
randomly
choose
a
mutation
operator
swap
bitflip
or
trim
and
produce
a
different
file
with
the
modified
lines
This
means
for
each
input
file
the
fuzzer
will
produce
one
output
file
where
each 
line
is
modified
with
a
random
mutation
operator
